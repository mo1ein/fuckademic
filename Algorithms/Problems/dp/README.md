## 1. [Climbing Stairs](./ClimbingStairs.cpp)
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

## 2. [Minimum Path Sum](./MinimumPathSum.cpp)
Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
```
Input:
grid = [
          [1, 3, 1],
          [1, 5, 1],
          [4, 2, 1]
       ]

Output: 7 // Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
```
