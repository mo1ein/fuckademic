## 1. [Rotate Image](./RotateImage1.cpp)
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
```
Input:
matrix = [
            [1,2,3],
            [4,5,6],
            [7,8,9]
         ]

Output:
matrix = [
            [7,4,1],
            [8,5,2],
            [9,6,3]
         ]
```
