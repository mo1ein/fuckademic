# fuckademic
This word is mixed with *fuck* + *academic*. It's good for people who hate academic shits (classes, grades, ranks, professors, ...) and want to learn from the free internet world like me.
I created this repo to share my learning process in **computer science** & **software enginnering** stuffs. Maybe this is the biggest project in my life.
