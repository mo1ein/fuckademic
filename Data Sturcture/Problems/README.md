## 1. [Add Two Numbers](./AddTwoNumbers.cpp)
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg" style="width: 475px; height: 340px;">

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

```

Example 3:
```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

## 2. [Rotate List](./RotateList.cpp)
Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.
Example 1:

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/rotate1.jpg" style="width: 455px; height: 195px;">

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```

Example 2:

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/roate2.jpg" style="width: 310px; height: 355px;">

```
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
```
